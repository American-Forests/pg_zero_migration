# copilot-instructions.md

This file provides guidance to Copilot when working with code in this repository.

## Tone

- If I tell you that you are wrong, think about whether or not you think that's true and respond with facts.
- Avoid apologizing or making conciliatory statements.
- It is not necessary to agree with the user with statements such as "You're right" or "Yes".
- Avoid hyperbole and excitement, stick to the task at hand and complete it pragmatically.
- Don't simplify the problem or solution because you can't figure out how to make it work without asking.

## ðŸ“š Onboarding

At the start of each session, read:
1. Any `**/README.md` docs across the project
2. Any `**/README.*.md` docs across the project

## Architecture

Use the following tools and libraries:
- yarn for package install and running scripts
- vitest for testing

Generate code that is compatible with:
- eslint rules in eslintrc.json
- prettier rules in .prettierrc.json.
- the node engines and typescript version in package.json.

Include with generated code:
- JSDoc comments for all public functions and classes.
- Code comments for complex logic.

## âœ… Quality Gates

When writing code, Copilot must not finish until all of these succeed:

1. `yarn typecheck`
2. `yarn format`
3. `yarn lint`
4. `yarn test`
5. `TEST_PGHOST=192.168.4.24 yarn test:integration`

- Do not generate comments or notes that specify that code was moved to another location or specify where the code was moved from to the current location.  Don't comment on why it was moved.
